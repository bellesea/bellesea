## Welcome :) üëã
Hi! I'm Belle, a sophomore CS and Public Policy major at Wellesley College! I love learning and making things :)

#### üëÄ Currently, I'm...
- Using python to create a real-time news-aware auditing pipeline to collect political posts across TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube (Repo is private as we're writing a paper!)
- Making random projects that bring joy like a [4-foot goose plushie](https://cloud-r5vloorda-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2024-09-27_at_7.36.59_pm.png), an [object scanner](https://youtube.com/shorts/BKz8F9wBCo4?si=YtKgHyjETSW4Zo11), and patched-fabric skirt (in-progress)
- Helping people make their projects come to life with 
- Reading [Protecting Soldiers and Mothers: The Political Origins of Social Policy in the United States](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674717664) and [The Third Pillar](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/566369/the-third-pillar-by-raghuram-rajan/)

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Previously, I took a gap year with [@hackclub](https://github.com/hackclub) and...
- Built [hackclub.com](https://hackclub.com)
- Supported highschoolers with their [electronic project grants](https://hackclub.com/winter)
- Organized a [few](https://github.com/hackclub/outernet) [hackathons](https://github.com/hackclub/days-of-service) for hundreds of students

#### ü§î I enjoy thinking about...
- Why we connect with other people and how :)
- How processes can be improved
- Why institutions maintain power
